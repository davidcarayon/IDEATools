Description: Content-preserving transformations transformations of PDF files such 
    as split, combine, and compress. This package interfaces directly to the 'qpdf' 
    C++ API and does not require any command line utilities. Note that 'qpdf' does
    not read actual content from PDF files: to extract text and data you need the
    'pdftools' package.
