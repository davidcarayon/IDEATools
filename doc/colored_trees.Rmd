The algorithm for producing colored trees is the result of a long work involving the testing of many methods and R packages. In the end, the solution chosen was to draw the models in "white" on a vectorial drawing software (Inkscape) in svg format. SVG is a markup language (similar to XML or HTML) with which it is fairly easy to apply search and replace algorithms. A rectangle tag (corresponding to a node of the illuminated tree) can be written :


    <rect
           style="fill:#ffffff;fill-opacity:1;stroke:#001800;stroke-width:0.1"
           id="rect2-16"
           width="17.833706"
           height="4.9643545"
           x="370.30774"
           y="143.9761"
           inkscape:label="#rect2-16" />

So all we have to do is find the tag for each rectangle, assign each rectangle identifier to its corresponding indicator, then we can search-replace the argument "fill:#ffffff" by the appropriate color corresponding to the evaluation :

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cap_canvas.png")
```

IDEATools then converts this modified SVG source code to a proper PNG/PDF image using the `{rsvg}` library.

The templates are stored as internal object R named "canvas". It is a list containing in each element the complete SVG source code of each template. These white templates are exportable / viewable in the directory of your choice by using :

```{r eval=FALSE}
IDEATools::show_canvas("my_directory")
```
