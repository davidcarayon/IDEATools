## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 2 NOTEs:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: ‘David Carayon <david.carayon@inrae.fr>’

This NOTE can be safely ignored as it's my first submission.

* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
'lastMiKTeXException'

As noted in [R-hub issue #503](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503), this could be due to a bug/crash in MiKTeX and can likely be ignored.
